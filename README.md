## Subagent Usage

The `subagent` tool supports three modes:

**Single agent:**
```json
{ "agent": "worker", "task": "implement user authentication" }
```

**Parallel (independent tasks, up to 8 tasks / 4 concurrent):**
```json
{ "tasks": [
  { "agent": "worker", "task": "fix auth module" },
  { "agent": "worker", "task": "fix payment module" }
]}
```

**Chain (sequential handoff with `{previous}` placeholder):**
```json
{ "chain": [
  { "agent": "scout", "task": "find code related to auth" },
  { "agent": "planner", "task": "plan changes using {previous}" },
  { "agent": "worker", "task": "implement: {previous}" }
]}
```

## Agent Customization

Agents are discovered from three sources (highest priority first):

1. **Project agents** — `.pi/agents/` in your project directory
2. **User agents** — `~/.pi/agent/agents/`
3. **Bundled agents** — shipped with this package

Override any bundled agent by creating a `.md` file with the same `name` in your project or user agents directory.

## Orchestration Features

### Tier System

Model tiers map agent capabilities to cost-appropriate models:

| Tier | Default Model | Agents |
|------|--------------|--------|
| `fast` | claude-haiku-4-5 | scout, writer |
| `standard` | claude-sonnet-4-6 | planner, worker, code-reviewer, designer, researcher, scientist, vision |
| `reasoning` | claude-opus-4-6 | bug-hunter, security-reviewer, issue-validator, architect, critic |

Override via `.pi/superpowers.json`:
```json
{
  "models": { "fast": "claude-haiku-4-5", "standard": "claude-sonnet-4-6", "reasoning": "claude-opus-4-6" },
  "routing": { "defaultTier": "standard" }
}
```

### Execution Strategies

The `executing-plans` skill supports 4 strategies:

| Strategy | Flag | Best For |
|----------|------|----------|
| Sequential | (default) | Dependent tasks, small plans |
| Parallel | `--parallel` | Many independent tasks |
| Autopilot | `--autopilot` | Large plans, hands-off |
| Ralph | `--ralph` | PRD with user stories |

### Planning Workflows

- **`/plan`** — Detects broad vs. specific requests, routes to interview or direct planning
- **`/ralplan`** — Consensus planning: planner → architect → critic review loop

### State Management

The `state` tool provides persistent state for execution modes:
```
state read <key>        — Read state
state write <key> {...} — Write state
state clear <key>       — Delete state
state list              — List all active states
```

## Multi-Agent Code Review

The `/code-review` command runs a comprehensive review pipeline that orchestrates multiple agents across model tiers:

```
Pre-flight (scout/haiku) → Config discovery (scout/haiku) → Summarize (sonnet)
→ Parallel review: 2× compliance audit (sonnet) + 2× bug hunt (opus)
→ Validate each issue independently (opus/sonnet) → Filter → Report
```

Only high-signal, independently validated issues are reported. See `skills/code-review/SKILL.md` for full pipeline documentation.

### Model Configuration

The pipeline defaults to Claude models but supports any provider Pi can use. All configuration lives in a single `.pi/superpowers.json` file:

```json
{
  "models": {
    "fast": "claude-haiku-4-5",
    "standard": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
    "reasoning": "claude-opus-4-6"
  },
  "routing": {
    "enabled": true,
    "defaultTier": "standard",
    "agentTierOverrides": {
      "scout": "fast",
      "bug-hunter": "reasoning",
      "security-reviewer": "reasoning",
      "issue-validator": "reasoning"
    }
  },
  "persistence": {
    "maxIterations": 50,
    "staleTimeout": 14400
  },
  "delegation": {
    "audit": true,
    "enforce": false
  }
}
```

**Config sections:**
- **models** — Map each tier to a model. Swap in GPT, Gemini, or local models here.
- **routing** — Control tier resolution: `defaultTier` for untagged agents, `agentTierOverrides` for per-agent tier assignments.
- **persistence** — Limits for continuation loops (ralph/autopilot): max iterations and stale timeout (seconds).
- **delegation** — Audit logging for direct source file writes; `enforce` blocks them entirely.

**Override priority:** Project agent overrides (`.pi/agents/<agent>.md` with `model:` in frontmatter) take precedence over config file settings. User agent overrides (`~/.pi/agent/agents/`) serve as cross-project defaults. Falls back to `.pi/code-review.json` if `.pi/superpowers.json` is not found.

See `skills/code-review/model-config.md` for provider-specific examples (Claude, GPT, Gemini, local models).

## Security Review

The `/security-review` command runs a multi-agent security audit focused on exploitable vulnerabilities with minimal false positives:

```
Context gathering (scout/haiku) → Security audit (security-reviewer/opus)
→ Hard filter (exclusion rules) → Validate each finding (issue-validator/opus) → Report
```

Features:
- 3-phase methodology: context research, comparative analysis, vulnerability assessment
- Hard exclusion rules filter out known false-positive categories (DOS, rate limiting, etc.)
- Independent validation of each finding before reporting
- Customizable via `.pi/security-instructions.txt` and `.pi/security-exclusions.txt`
- Can run standalone or integrated into the code-review pipeline

See `skills/security-review/SKILL.md` for full pipeline documentation.
